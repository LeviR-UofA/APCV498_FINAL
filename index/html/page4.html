            C programming is a procedural programming language. C is known for its low-level features, allowing direct manipulation of memory 
            addresses, making it suitable for systems programming, embedded systems, and development of operating systems. In contrast, 
            object-oriented programming (OOP) languages, such as Java, follow a different paradigm. OOP is based on the concept of objects, which 
            encapsulate data and behavior, promoting modularity, reusability, and abstraction. C is closer to the hardware, offering greater control 
            but requiring explicit memory management, while Java, an OOP language, abstracts away low-level details, prioritizing ease of development,
            portability, and code organization. Both languages have their strengths and are used in various contexts, with C excelling in 
            systems-level programming and Java being widely employed for enterprise applications, web development, and Android app development.

            I learned C programming my first semester here at University of Arizona, & while it was different than Java my only other programming
            language I knew at the time, it was a fun struggle learning. I had to learn to declare my memory & was introduced to Linked-Lists
            which was a difficult concept for me to learn.

                Week 6: I was able to work through making an Adventure Game with features that allow you to move into different rooms in a house.
                There was a map so you could only walk into rooms connected to the current location, & items that you could pick up in different rooms.
                It invloved lots of checks & I used loops, & switch case statements to handle the different options.
